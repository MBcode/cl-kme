The language-agnosting parts of IPython are moving to a new home that's not so Python-specific: @ProjectJupyter 
@_inundata @ellisonbg IPython's not going away, it's just shrinking to the Python Jupyter kernel + "better Python shell" (sloooowly)

Not sure how quickly Jupyter will come along, so might try hdf5 connection, then run remote code off of that.

Try our https://github.com/plops/sb-hdf/blob/master/hdf.lisp further/looks good so far.

mikiobraun ‏@mikiobraun  Now I can report I discussed HDF5 on HDFS potential at least once seriously. Wonder about HDF5's splitability, though.
 Andrew Musselman ‏@akm @mikiobraun Ha we toyed with that @agibsonccc
 mikiobraun ‏@mikiobraun @akm @agibsonccc And? Is it splittable?
 Andrew Musselman ‏@akm  @mikiobraun Never looked at that, just put the hdf5 files into HBase cells one by one @agibsonccc
 agibsonccc ‏@agibsonccc @akm @mikiobraun It's an interesting idea. My interest in this was seeing two things that normally aren't in the same sentence together
 mikiobraun ‏@mikiobraun @agibsonccc @akm I think this is even a somewhat legitimate question as HDF5 is used to store scientific data.
I know there is multithreaded/parallel access to HDF files, which can have parts in other files; but didn't find specifics w/which to respond to them.

    This may be like blasphemy for those who love the ipython type notebook, but I hope that I could use this API for passing objects in other IDEs.
    I find programming in R Studio (for the purpose of data analysis) far better than a notebook style setup. Notebooks seems good for documenting / presenting but any serious machine learning seems hard to do in it...

If I have not said before bobak@balisp.org no longer works; the site was not paid for&even though I heard it would be taken care of/it looks like it is gone for good.
 Unfortunately there are many places that I used this email, &very few sites that take into account the loss of an email.  Please use my gmail instead.
 As I also don't trust that my computer.org email will work forever;  Wish aaai.org had a forwarding service.

Ipython/Jupyter looks great, but might like it in more of an Rstudio setting ;maybe w/some Lightable/etc like ide abilities as well...

3.10 A functional programming approach: SGP 
Simple Grid Protocol (SGP) is a set of protocols and software for Linux and BSD. It is programmed 
in CLISP (a Common Lisp implementation). LISP is a well-known functional programming language.  
Programs written in such languages are nearly automatically (without much extra effort) useable for 
multithreaded, parralel execution. Each function can be executed in parralel. SGP is a small and not 
widely used project, but the functional approach is interesting.  • http://grid.bmk.com.au/

Karin Ahlin @karinahlin Do you need tool(s) for creating, opening up and publishing #opendata ? Here are some suggestions: https://github.com/theodi/open-data-tech-review/wiki … …? 

github.com/angavrilov/cl-mpi or github.com/marcoheisig/cl-mpi http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/projects/PnetCDF/ https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/parallel-netcdf or hdf5, though py/R bridges too
    Would still like a semantic HDF(5), metadata/tree w/the data; so could auto-connect via urn/uri between ipy/r/etc compuatation, no just data-frame or cube, (well semantic datacube re).
